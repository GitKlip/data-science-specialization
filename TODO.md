make separate section in portfolio for impressive data visualizaitons
building models -> dramatically increase complexity
    1) Always start dead simple with baseline model
    2) compare new candidate models to that baseline
    3) only add complexity if you can demonstrate there's a real win for it.

    Stick to documenting your learning and progress over time instead of worrying about being flashy. You're much better off just working though problem you find interesting and making note of 
    - things you learned, 
    - things that surprised you,
    - problems you encountered 
    - how you overcame those challenges
    
    I don't think my site had a very big impact on getting a job (I will be joining a company as a data scientist once I finish grad school in a few months). It did, though, have a big impact on my learning. Knowing people might view my site gave me extra incentive to keep adding stuff to it. 

    A list of projects you've worked on that are related to software development, statistics, databases, etc. Make a web page on a URL of your name and make a page that looks like a resume.
