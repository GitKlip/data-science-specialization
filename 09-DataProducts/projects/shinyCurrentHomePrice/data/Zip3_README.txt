"HPI for Three-Digit ZIP Codes (All-Transactions Index)
Experimental Indexes"				
				
* These indexes should be considered developmental.  As with the standard HPI, revisions to this index may reflect the impact of new data.  Indexes are calibrated using appraisal values and sales prices for mortgages bought or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  As discussed in the Technical Note published with the 2014Q4 HPI, in cases where sample sizes are small for the three-digit ZIP Code area, the index reported reflects the index for the Metropolitan Statistical or state nonmetropolitan area.  The table reports whether the index is the native three-digit ZIP index or if it  is an index for one of the other areas.
